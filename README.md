# Domain-Expert-Model-Proof-of-Concept-POC-

Project Overview
This project aims to fine-tune the Meta Llama 2 7B language model to become a domain-specific expert in [chosen domain: finance, medical, or IT]. The objective is to enhance the model's ability to generate informative, accurate, and contextually relevant responses for chat applications, internal knowledge applications, or text content generation.

Project Tasks
Dataset Selection:

Choose an appropriate, copyright-free unstructured text dataset relevant to the selected domain (finance, medical, or IT).
The dataset will be used to train and adapt the Meta Llama 2 7B model.
Fine-Tuning the Language Model:

Utilize Amazon SageMaker and other AWS tools to fine-tune the Meta Llama 2 7B model.
Adapt the model to the selected domain, focusing on improving its understanding and generation of domain-specific text.
Deployment and Testing:

Deploy the fine-tuned model on AWS SageMaker.
Test and evaluate the modelâ€™s responses to domain-specific queries and text-generation tasks.
Documentation:

Document the process, challenges faced, and the solutions implemented.
Prepare a comprehensive report and presentation summarizing the project.
Environment Configuration
AWS Account Setup:

Ensure you have an AWS account with access to Amazon SageMaker.
Set up billing alerts to stay within the $25 budget for the project.
AWS SageMaker Configuration:

Configure AWS SageMaker resources as required.
Deploy the Meta Llama 2 7B foundation model using SageMaker.
Python and SageMaker API:

Use Python scripts and SageMaker APIs to interact with the model.
Implement code for fine-tuning, testing, and evaluating the model.
Cost Management
Resource Management:
Stop SageMaker instances when not in use.
Delete model resources and endpoints after completion of the project.
Avoid using additional AWS resources not required for this project.
